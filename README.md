## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I took a desktop first approach to styling this project but I found this to be a bit awkward and unintuitive so next time I'll try a mobile-first approach

### Continued development

I want to continue working with CSS grids to get some practice and muscle memory as well as expand my knowledge of them. Additionally, I'd like do more responsive media query design to see if I can develop some more intuition about how best to approach it.
